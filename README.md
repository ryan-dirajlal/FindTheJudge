# FindTheJudge

My code implements the examples given in the lab through the algorithm. It checks to see if there are any "people" with incoming edges from every person in the population (minus themselves) and zero outgoing edges. If this condition is met, then the poplation trusts that person, and that person trusts nobody else, making them the judge. Else, -1 is returned as the judge is not found.
